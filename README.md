About
====

This directory contains the code and resources of the following paper:

"Disease Gene Prediction with Privileged Information and Heteroscedastic Dropout". Under review.

1.LUPI_RGCN is a relational GNN-based classification algorithm for graphs. It takes disease gene network as inputs and predict the possible associations.  
2.Our experimental results are based on gene disease network data developed in [1]. The data can be obtained here[data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y5ZSxHq6psjfVE2OreyjJQ7xsZlIq4kL?usp=sharing)
